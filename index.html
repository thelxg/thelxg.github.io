                <p>Hello League!</p>

                <p>It’s been awhile since we got slapped across the face with a good ol' wall of text note. It's really
                    only
                    by
                    accident that you're reading this and not being lulled into a state of nirvana by the dulcet tones
                    of
                    Shawn
                    and
                    I
                    jackhammering you with fantasy football hot takes. You see, we recorded a solid hour+ long breakdown
                    of
                    the
                    power
                    ranks, it was glorious, probably the best show we'll ever do, there were so many insights so many
                    jokes
                    so
                    many
                    scorching hot takes! That episode will never come to light unfortunately, as only half the audio
                    recorded...
                    fucking
                    OBS fucked me, I blame Moise. Shawn and I had discussed recording a make-up episode, but frankly
                    there's
                    just no
                    time with our schedules and we'd like to get a short predictions video up this week as well. So!
                    Wall of
                    text!</p>

                <p>Before I kick into the proceedings, shouts outs to all you kind good-natured animals. Was really good
                    to
                    see
                    you
                    all
                    and claws on the beach is going to be tough to top! Claw life, man, claw life. The look on our boy’s
                    face
                    when
                    LA
                    Beast said Moise was priceless. Auction was intense, based on the self-ranks I got back, looks like
                    everyone
                    came
                    away with a team they like, which is absolutely the goal of an auction, we continue to see variety
                    in
                    strategy
                    and
                    the evolving poker tactics of bidding. I think you guys generally know how much time I put in before
                    the
                    draft
                    (especially to make you such lovely video intros), but in case it’s not as obvious Shawn did a fuck
                    ton
                    of
                    work
                    this
                    year from reserving the BnB to the van, to making a custom sound board, hand crafting more than half
                    those
                    fire
                    ass
                    comedy drops, making the menu and cooking, driving both ways, draft honestly could not have happened
                    as
                    smoothly
                    as
                    it did without him. He's the real MVP of draft weekend and its not close. Here's to hoping we can
                    get
                    everyone
                    to
                    Vegas next year, would really mean a lot.</p>

                <h6 class="font-weight-bold">!!!!MENU CHANGE!!!!!</h6>
                <p>So... We all saw some schlub in a bright green tube eat 2 pieces of tortilla and declare "Can't do
                    it!"
                    we
                    were
                    all
                    a bit shocked, and nobody said anything, but in retrospect this just cannot be allowed to fly in the
                    future.
                    I'm
                    not
                    saying we should have forced him to eat the burrito, if you can't do it, you can't do it, but we
                    should
                    have
                    had
                    a
                    more specifically outlined criteria for pivoting to either an Ole' Fashioned or a Beer Mile. For
                    example, if
                    you
                    got
                    2 hours into your stay at Walmart, or 2 sections into your SAT, and said "can't do it" that's fine
                    but
                    you
                    gotta
                    do
                    something else instead. I'm sure I'm preaching to the choir here. Going forward! All menu items will
                    be
                    designed
                    to
                    be completed, we will no longer be on a "best effort" honor system, somebody done fucked that up! If
                    a
                    Menu
                    item
                    is
                    not completed it will be exchanged for an Ole' Fashioned or a Mike Mowery Memorial Beer Mile. Sound
                    fair? In
                    addition, the FGT vs Food item will remain on the menu, as it has not been satisfactorily attempted
                    yet.
                </p>

                    id="tobble">

                <h6 class="font-weight-bold">Daaaaamn Homey, you spent a lot on RBs!</h6>
                <p>The biggest take-away from the auction has got to be the inflation we saw at the RB position across
                    the
                    top
                    10.
                    Lordy lordy those were some big numbas. Barkley for $69 (nice) was pretty expected, but then we turn
                    around
                    and
                    see
                    Kamara also at $69 (nice) and the market was set. The next RBs then went for 65, 64, and 56 before
                    we
                    saw
                    some
                    reasonable discounts on DJ for 46 and Mixon for 40. High end WRs topped out at 53, 48, 48, 44, 43,
                    43,
                    before we
                    saw
                    a drop off to 35 for Evans. In sum, the top of the markets formed a plateau where guys were
                    virtually
                    valued
                    the
                    same followed by a cascading drop off from there. Nobody had excess money this year, as opposed to
                    3-4
                    people
                    with
                    wasted money last year, that’s a really impressive skill jump in just one year.</p>

                <h6 class="font-weight-bold">Power. Fucking. Ranks.</h6>
                <p>This year I kept separate the two forms of power ranks and give them each their own section. As
                    always,
                    I'll
                    give
                    you my takes on the teams as well for extra color and to remind you all how big my dick is.</p>

                <h6 class="font-weight-bold">Automated Ranks</h6>
                <p class="font-italic">You: WHAT ARE THESE NUMBERS!?</p>
                <p>Me: These automated ranks came from 3 different internet surf-zones: 1. Football Guys draft reports
                    cards, 2.
                    FantasyPros Power Ranks, 3. ESPN projections</p>
                <p class="font-italic">You: BUT CAN'T YOU MAKE NUMBERS SAY ANYTHING YOU WANT?!?</p>
                <p>Me: Obviously, and that's why science and specifically climate evolution change are a China lie, but
                    in
                    this
                    case
                    <span class="font-weight-bold">NO!</span> these numbers are objective as fuck. The Football guys
                    system
                    kicks back an auto-generated report
                    which
                    gives your chances of making the playoffs. Three numbers are given, %chance with "great" management,
                    "good"
                    management, and "average" management. I use the "average" number in all cases. The logic is simple,
                    the
                    league
                    is
                    too good for anybody to perform better than "average" in the context of the league, a solid 7 of us
                    make
                    all
                    the
                    right waiver claims for our needs and the right starting rosters almost every week. Football Guys
                    gives
                    you
                    these
                    %chance values based on 4 of their experts ranks, so your Football Guys score is an average of the
                    4.
                </p>
                <p class="font-italic">You: WOW! I'M NOT AVERAGE I'M GREAT! YOU'RE BAD! WHAT ABOUT FANTASY PROS!?!?!?
                </p>
                <p>Me: Fantasy Pros generates power ranks based on the 20 most accurate fantasy expert predictors from
                    last
                    year,
                    this
                    yields a 0-100 score.</p>
                <p class="font-italic">You: WHAT ABOUT ESPN!!?! I HATE ESPN PREDICTIONS AAHHHAJDSJDHV!!!</p>
                <p>Me: Since Mike Clay was hired ESPNs season long predictions have been better, the weekly is still
                    questionable.
                    For
                    the ESPN score, I added together your starting roster projected points, I then added your bench
                    points
                    together
                    and
                    reduced them by %60. The logic here is that ideally, in a season without injuries or busts, your
                    bench
                    will
                    hardly
                    see the field, so they shouldn't count as fully as your starters. This advantaged 7/10 teams in the
                    league
                    who
                    have
                    virtually no projected bench points. The calculation was Starter Points + (Bench Points x .4) =
                    Total

                <p class="font-italic">You: WHY ARE ALL THE NUMBERS NEAR 50!?!?</p>
                <p>Me: Great question! I standardized all the scores so that they could be meaningfully compared to each
                    other!
                    To
                    start each metric used a wildly different scale (%chance, 0-100 power number, 1500+ projected
                    points),
                    adding
                    them
                    together would be a disaster. In the past I've simply computed your rank on each metric and averages
                    your
                    rank.
                    This
                    is a decent enough system but you loose all of your effect size data. In other words, you don't know
                    how
                    much
                    better
                    team 1 is than team 2 and how much better team 5 is than team 10. By standardizing the scores you
                    get a
                    sense
                    for
                    just how much different the teams are. (For Rosen, I computed Zscores for each metric then converted
                    them to
                    Tscores
                    [WAIS style] for ease of viewing).</p>

                <p>All of these was pulled before the Hyde/McCoy news of late, I imagine there's a very slight uptick
                    for
                    both
                    Jazz
                    Cabbage and Dom Vio (Singletary pickup, McCoy's new spot), Duke has not moved in the ranks as of my
                    viewing
                    today.
                    Also imagine there would have been a very slight uptick for Adorable Pups with the Brisset
                    (seriously
                    WTF
                    was
                    that
                    pick) for John Brown move. Likely none of that moves the following conclusions.</p>

                <p>Yes, the computers like me. You probably have caught on this happens most years. Its because I spend
                    a
                    lot of
                    time
                    reading about fantasy football so the fantasy football industry is going to generally like what I've
                    done.
                    (I
                    should
                    note, none of these sources are where I pull my ranks, so my team hasn't been taught to the test).
                    Interestingly,
                    NVRB had the lowest projected starter points, but the highest projected bench points to such a
                    degree
                    that
                    even
                    when
                    reduced by 60% it boasted the overall projection to the top (by a fairly large margin). I would
                    interpret
                    this
                    to
                    mean something that you likely found when rating this team, the ceiling of the projected outcome
                    doesn't
                    stick
                    out
                    as top-end, but the depth ought to represent a pretty high floor.</p>

                <p>You'll notice there's a fair bit of variation. The most obvious source of variation is the experts
                    evaluation
                    of
                    your players. Additionally, you'll notice some site-wide variation around how important various
                    positions
                    were
                    weighted. It seems Football Guyz strongly prefers you have 2 beast RBS, and those that do were
                    bumped
                    up,
                    FantasyPros weights the positions more equally meaning those with a strong Flex were rewarded, ESPN
                    is
                    more
                    even
                    although it possibly weighs the bench a bit more despite the deliberate devaluation of bench
                    production
                    in
                    the
                    calculation. In aggregate I these numbers do point to some wild fluctuation in the quality of both
                    Flex
                    options
                    and
                    bench depth.</p>

                <p>Also of note, Football Guys hated Hand Grenades and Jazz Cabbage to a level I had never seen before,
                    getting
                    single
                    digit %chance to make playoffs from several experts (average was 20-40%).</p>

                <p>Fuck Drew for picking these divisions.</p>

                <p>The owner of the Hand Grenades has apparently been super busy, too busy for me to get a 1-10 list
                    from
                    him,
                    so
                    we
                    have 8 raters this year (we no longer ask the Pups as he always gives back a randomly ordered list).
                    I
                    will
                    discuss
                    the teams in the order they appeared on the draft board. As always I removed everyone’s self-rank
                    because
                    you
                    all
                    think you’re top 3 because *surprise!* you all like all your own players and think they’re the best!

                <p>Not a lot of disagreement here. We all think this is a pretty solid roster. More balanced than most
                    of
                    the
                    rosters,
                    and one of 4 teams that has legit WR depth. The lack of any none-lottery ticket RBs is a concern,
                    especially
                    given
                    how small McCaffery and Lindsey are and Sony’s knee troubles. Beckham, Cooper, and Alshon are also
                    notorious
                    for
                    coming up lame. (FUN FACT! Odell Beckham has missed more games than Sammy Watkins! They entered the
                    league
                    in
                    the
                    same year). As much as any team can be truly injury prone, this is the one that sticks out, even
                    Anderson
                    and
                    Jones
                    have had troubles recently. If they all stay healthy the talent is here, the big weeks should be
                    big,
                    but
                    that
                    WR
                    depth may be needed sooner than later.</p>
                <p>“I like Bukkakes Rbs, wilson is always a pretty solid pick. His wrs as long as healthy with be
                    productive. He
                    has
                    strong enough flex otherwise to contend every week.” -A person who isn’t me</p>

                <p>I didn’t rank me because I’m also not free from bias. That said, its not hard to evaluate this team.
                    Mixon’s
                    offense
                    likely pulls down his upside as compared to the other top10 backs, there is workload but possible
                    not
                    enough
                    blow-up
                    games. Fournette has been unstable, Ingram is a strong flex compared to nearly every other roster
                    and is
                    the
                    real
                    path forward here. Evans is kind of the Mixon of WRs, Diggs is an average and oft injured WR2,
                    Lockett
                    is
                    one of
                    the
                    best WR3s in the league. QB and TE exist and are fine. The bench is the strongest in the league, but
                    that
                    may
                    not
                    matter if nobody pops enough to win matchups. The deficits of this roster is at its peaks, and its
                    major
                    strengths
                    are the RB3 and WR3 positions where this team will need to majorly make-up ground.</p>

                <p>Shawn is the big bad wolf coming into the season. WRs are better than I think a lot of people
                    realize,
                    the
                    consistency of Hopkins and Adams is just going to create unfair matchups this year. Ridley/Boyd is
                    better
                    than
                    all
                    but one teams WR3 situation. RBs, while they should be a weakness, I see as average. Especially if
                    Carson
                    and
                    Montgomery live up to the hype. The real concern for me is that Latavius as an RB4 is pretty
                    low-upside,
                    Penny
                    and
                    Brieda (because of Go-Rape-a-Hoe) are trending down. QB/TE are fine.</p>

                <p>We all agree! Except two of you who put him 2 and 3. I assume their logic is “last year all he needed
                    was
                    2
                    dope
                    RBs
                    and playoffs!” Those people forget he hit on 3 WRs last year in Cooper, Woods, and Lockett all for
                    basically
                    free.
                    That doesn’t mean he couldn’t do it again, but it does mean that the reason he made the playoffs was
                    not
                    simply
                    “2
                    dope RBs nothing else.” The rest of us have rated the team accordingly. Having the #1 and #2 players
                    in
                    fantasy
                    is
                    pretty cool, those guys should be great. But RB3 is a joke and RB4 is worse. The WRs are closer to
                    average
                    than
                    they
                    should be thanks to a good deal on Gordon, but none of these 3 guys are what I would describe as
                    safe.
                    The
                    bench
                    is
                    a wasteland. Even if the 2 studs stay healthy I don’t love this team, if Saquon can’t repeat his

                    in

                    scrubs

                    values.
                    The bright spot of Bell didn’t seem worth the cost of having McCoy at RB3, before the move to KC,
                    and
                    there’s
                    nothing at all at RB4. Julio, Allen, Woods are strong and should be a weekly advantage against all
                    but a
                    couple
                    teams, but WR4 and below are non-existent. Mahomes and Kittle should be weekly advantages even with

                    count on
                    them down the stretch. Winning now is more important than winning later, so the strategy itself at
                    RB
                    isn’t
                    a
                    problem, but the rest of the roster is incredibly ill-suited for that goal. Cooks was my WR3 last
                    year,
                    and
                    he
                    was a
                    mismatch all year in that role, he’s not who you necessarily want at WR1. I’m gonna fade Edelman
                    every
                    year
                    until
                    he’s out of the league. Fuller is a WR4 that he has to start every week. TE is average. Guice, Drake
                    and
                    Henderson
                    (handcuff) are not bad depth at RB, but the WR depth is a fucking joke. I don’t expect this team to
                    be
                    better

                    this
                    is
                    three
                    RB2s with depth behind them, at worst its 15 combined points a week. WR1 and 2 are strong, and
                    Pettis is
                    probably a
                    solid enough WR3. The depth WRs are lottery tickets but at least they could hit big with the right

                    I’m
                    not mad at it. Watson and Ertz should continue to be an advantage. In aggregate this team ends up
                    better
                    than
                    most,
                    but if waiver claims need be made, color be concerned.</p>

                <p>I had 5, seriously 5, different people rank this team top 4 and to each them I asked them to “please
                    google
                    AJ
                    Green” each responded “oh shit, drop him to X.” I’m honestly not sure if y’all knew he was hurt
                    during
                    the
                    auction
                    and forgot or if somehow half the league was unaware that this dude is still in a walking boot. I
                    agree
                    that
                    with a
                    fully healthy Green this team is better, but that would have cost $15 more than he paid at minimum.
                    Anyway,
                    I
                    think
                    Drew knows we disagree here, so this shouldn’t be a shock, I dislike this team. I’m working from the
                    baseline
                    that
                    Green and Gordon don’t meaningfully contribute until it’s too late. Injury optimism is a trap
                    (remember
                    Baldwin
                    last
                    year?) and holdouts are unpredictable AF. Godwin is a WR3 cast as a WR1, Landry is a lowend WR3 cast
                    as
                    a
                    WR2,
                    Gallup is a WR5 cast as a WR3. Ekeler and Pollard aren’t true handcuffs, they’re satellite players,
                    they
                    don’t
                    really play the same positions as the bellcows. The bench is as cute as the face on a 400lb chick
                    would
                    need
                    to
                    be
                    to bang her. Rookie WR off knee surgery, rookie TE, rookie WR who’s 4th on the depth chart, yikes.
                    This
                    team
                    is
                    a
                    strictly worse version of the Puppies. -Drew has made like 5 moves before the season started, he
                    knew as
                    well as
                    anyone that bench was ridiculous. You ain’t gotta lie to kick it man, just own it.

                    <p>Y’all hate the shit outta this team, as does the industry, I somehow ended up hating it slightly
                        less.
                        Truly
                        a
                        team
                        without a strength. RBs at the top aren’t bad, but Howard and Peterson are the same guy and that
                        guy
                        is
                        probably
                        going to lose his job in a couple weeks. WRs are pretty strong at the top, but Kupp off an ACL
                        is a
                        gamble,
                        Watkins
                        is a cuff and Sanu made this roster… The stars aren’t near good enough to justify the scrubs
                        here.

                    <p>Man… The answer to the question “what happens when you spend $60 on Conner” is… meh? Mack takes a
                        slight
                        hit
                        from no
                        Luck and Coleman was overrated all summer. Brown, Golladay, Kirk are a 1,2,3 but no better than
                        that
                        and
                        with
                        absolutely nobody of value behind them. Taking Hunt was a meme. Like DV, the QB/TE need to carry
                        a
                        lot
                        of
                        load
                        here,
                        injuries and bye weeks are likely going to expose serious flaws if they hit early. I’m kinda
                        giving
                        Rosen
                        credit
                        for
                        his past ability to captain winning teams with this rank.</p>
                    <p>“What can I say about Rosen that hasn't already been said by Crystal Espinal about Tyreek Hill:
                        He
                        beats
                        us
                        and
                        we
                        should be afraid of him. With a well-rounded roster, particularly at WR, QB, and TE, look for
                        him to
                        continue to
                        occupy the top spots of the rankings in 2019.” -It wasn’t me</p>

                    <p>Well I think that about does it! I hope all the bad things in life happen only to you.</p>
